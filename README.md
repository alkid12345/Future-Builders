# Future-Builders
The goal of this project is to create a lightweight inventory management tool for small businesses to track stock levels, monitor sales, and alert when restocking is needed. It will consist of a simple user interface and basic backend functionality
Introduction to the Simple Inventory Management System (SIMS)
Welcome to our project repository for the Simple Inventory Management System (SIMS)! This software engineering initiative is a collaborative effort among our dedicated team members, each bringing unique skills and perspectives to the table. Our primary goal is to develop a robust and user-friendly inventory management solution tailored specifically for small-scale food retailers and distributors in the Bombali District of Sierra Leone.

Project Background
Small-scale food businesses in Bombali face significant challenges in managing their inventory, particularly with perishable goods such as mangoes and staple foods like rice. Many of these businesses rely on outdated manual processes, which can lead to inefficiencies, inaccuracies, and lost revenue. Additionally, the absence of real-time tracking and efficient reporting mechanisms exacerbates these issues.

Our Mission
The SIMS project aims to address these challenges by providing a streamlined system that enables users to:

Manage Products Efficiently: Track various product types and their statuses in real time.
Record Sales and Purchases: Keep accurate records of transactions to facilitate better financial management.
Generate Comprehensive Reports: Produce insightful reports that help users make informed business decisions.
Ensure Security and Scalability: Build a system that is secure and can grow alongside the businesses it serves.
Through our collaborative efforts, we aspire to empower small-scale food retailers and distributors, enabling them to operate more efficiently and effectively. We invite you to explore our GitHub repository, where you can find our progress, contributions, and future plans for the SIMS project.
